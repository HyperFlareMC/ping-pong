# ping-pong
 A vanilla Javascript-built Ping-Pong game!
 
 This is a basic game using built-in Javascript and HTML features to create basic shapes and events for ping-pong. This game is 100% open sourced, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve it, open an issue or make a PR. 

# IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
I am still adding new features and making the functionality more normal everyday, so please be patient. Feel free to contribute if you are interested in helping. Thanks for reading!
