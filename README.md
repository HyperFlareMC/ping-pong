# ping-pong
 A vanilla Javascript-built Ping-Pong game!
 
 This is a basic game using built-in Javascript and HTML features to create basic shapes and events for ping-pong. This game is 100% open sourced, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve it, open an issue or make a PR. 

# It is stable
This game is finally at a point of stability, the general gameplay works and is functional. If you think numbers should be tweaked, or want new features, open an issue or DM me on Discord: HyperFlare#7018

Thanks for reading, and enjoy playing!
